# Database-GUI-Elmasri-and-Navathe-
A simple GUI application to perform a series of basic queries on a sample database from "Fundamentals of Database Systems" by Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant Navathe (See section 6.1.2 for the SQL queries used to construct the schema). Some important things to note:
1) The code was created using PyQt5 designer to build the UI files, and then converted them to python files using a command.
2) If you are running this application on a windows computer like I did, you will need to install PyQt5 and mysql-connector-python.
3)  You can run the file dbproject2.py after you create a file named mydb.conf which contains a variable named host which contains your ip address, the name of the sql database, username, password, and port.
4) The labels can be screwed up by the resolution of your screen. I suggest using the recommended settings.
